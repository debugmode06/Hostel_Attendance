## NAVIGATION_SETUP.dart - DEPRECATED

**This file is deprecated and should not be used as-is.**

It was created as a reference guide showing how to integrate the new screens into navigation. However, it contains syntax errors and incomplete code because it's meant to be a guide, not executable code.

### Use Instead:
- Refer to `NAVIGATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for proper navigation integration steps
- Copy and paste code examples from that markdown file into your actual `main.dart`

### What to Do:
1. Open your `main.dart`
2. Add the screen imports shown in `NAVIGATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
3. Update your navigation/tab structure to use the new screens
4. Test by running `flutter run`

### Do NOT:
- Try to import or use NAVIGATION_SETUP.dart directly
- Copy the entire file as-is (it has syntax errors intentionally to show structure)

The actual screen implementations are fully complete and error-free:
- ✅ `lib/screens/face_scan_screen_premium.dart`
- ✅ `lib/screens/face_register_screen_auto.dart`
- ✅ `lib/screens/reports_screen.dart`
- ✅ `lib/screens/bulk_student_upload_screen_complete.dart`
